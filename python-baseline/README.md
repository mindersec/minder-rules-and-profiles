# Python Baseline

A Minder profile that checks Python repositories for common project hygiene
practices. The rules are intentionally tool-agnostic: they detect whatever
tool you already use and only open a remediation PR when nothing is
configured at all.

## What it checks

| Rule | What it looks for |
|------|-------------------|
| `python_lock_file_exists` | A lock file (Pipfile.lock, poetry.lock, pdm.lock) or pinned requirements.txt |
| `python_pyproject_toml_exists` | A pyproject.toml (the modern Python project standard) |
| `python_type_checker_configured` | mypy, pyright, or pytype in config files or CI |
| `python_linter_configured` | ruff, flake8, or pylint in config files or CI |

All rules are automatically skipped for repositories that show no signs of
being a Python project.

## Installation

```bash
minder apply -f path/to/python-baseline
```

This applies both the rule types and the profile in a single step.

To enable automated remediation (PRs to add missing config files), set
`remediate: "on"` in `profiles/python-baseline.yaml` before applying.
