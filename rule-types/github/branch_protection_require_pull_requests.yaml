description: Verifies that a branch requires pull requests
guidance: |
  Ensure that the setting to require a pull request before merging to
  a branch is enabled for the branch protection rule.

  This requires that a pull request be opened before merging to a
  branch.

  For more information, see [GitHub's
  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
