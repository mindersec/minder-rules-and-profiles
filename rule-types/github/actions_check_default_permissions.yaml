description: Alerts on default GitHub Actions permissions
guidance: |
  Ensure that GitHub Actions have permissions specified.

  The default permissions for GitHub Actions allow broad access to the repository,
  including the ability to update repo contents, approve pull requests, and update
  releases, packages, and deployments.  To limit these permissions, specify
  permissions explicitly either in the top level of the workflow file, or for each
  job in the workflow.
