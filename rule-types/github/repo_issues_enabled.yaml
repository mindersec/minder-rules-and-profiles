  Verifies that a repository has its issue tracker enabled.
  This helps ensure repositories are configured for proper issue tracking
  and community engagement.
guidance: |
  Ensure that the repository's issue tracker is enabled.

  The issue tracker should be enabled when you want to:
  - Track bugs, enhancements, and other requests
  - Foster community discussions and feedback
  - Create and track milestones
  - Manage project work items directly in GitHub

  For more information, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/disabling-issues).
