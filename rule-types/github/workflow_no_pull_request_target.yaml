description: |
  Alerts on GitHub Actions workflows that use the pull_request_target event.

  The pull_request_target event allows GitHub Actions workflows to run
  on pull requests from forks. This can be a security risk, as the event may,
  if used improperly, allow untrusted code to run in the repository.

  For more information, see [GitHub's
  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).
guidance: |
  Ensure that GitHub Actions workflows do not use the pull_request_target event.

  Either remove the pull_request_target event from the workflow and use the
  pull_request event instead, remove the workflow completely or split the workflow
  into a privileged one that uses pull_request_target and a non-privileged one
  triggered on workflow_run.
