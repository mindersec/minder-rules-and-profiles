description: Disallow force pushes to the branch
guidance: |
  Ensure that the appropriate setting is disabled for the branch
  protection rule.

  This setting prevents users with push access to force push to the
  branch.

  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
