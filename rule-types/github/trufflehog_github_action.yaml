  Verifies that automated secret detection is implemented using TruffleHog GitHub 
  Action to scan repositories for exposed secrets and sensitive information. 
  This is crucial for preventing data breaches and unauthorized access that 
  could occur from accidentally committed credentials, API keys, or other 
  sensitive data. Regular scanning helps maintain security compliance and protects your organization's assets.

  For technical details, see the [TruffleHog documentation](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) 
  and [GitHub Action implementation guide](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/trufflehog-oss).
guidance: |
  Ensure that TruffleHog is configured and enabled for the repository.

  For more information, see the [TruffleHog GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/trufflehog-oss#octocat-trufflehog-github-action documentation.
