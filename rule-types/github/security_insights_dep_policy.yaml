  Parses the repository's `SECURITY_INSIGHTS.yaml` file and looks for a 
  pointer to a dependency policy.

  [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/) is a 
  specification that lets projects publish data and pointers to resources about
  the repository, maintainers, releases and other security aspects in a 
  machine-readable format to make it easy for automated tools to locate them.

  This ruletype parses the security insights yaml and checks for a pointer to
  the dependencies policy (`policy-url`). No attempt to retrieve it is done.

guidance: |
  If you have a security insights file (defaults to `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml`),
  ensure that the dependency policy field is defined
  (`dependencies.env-dependencies-policy.policy-url`).
  
  For more information on how to create one, refer to the SI specification at
  https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/
