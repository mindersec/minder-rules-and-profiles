version: v1
release_phase: alpha
type: rule-type
name: security_insights_dep_policy
display_name: Verify a dependency policy exists in the Security Insights file
severity:
  value: low
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  Parses the repository's `SECURITY_INSIGHTS.yaml` file and looks for a 
  pointer to a dependency policy.

  This ruletype parses the security insights yaml and checks for a pointer to
  the dependencies policy (`policy-url`). No attempt to retrieve it is done.

guidance: |
  If you have a security insights file (defaults to
  `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml`), ensure that the dependency policy field is
  defined (`dependencies.env-dependencies-policy.policy-url`).

  [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/)
  is a specification that lets projects publish data and pointers to
  resources about the repository, maintainers, releases and other
  security aspects in a machine-readable format to make it easy for
  automated tools to locate them.
  
  For more information on how to create one, refer to the [SI
  specification](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/).
