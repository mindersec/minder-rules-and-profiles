  Verifies that a repository contains a `SECURITY_INSIGHTS.yaml` file.

  This initial rule type checks for the existence of the file only.
guidance: |
  Check that your repository contains a Security Insights file to
  ensure your security data can be located by automated processes.

  [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/)
  is a specification that lets projects publish data and pointers to
  resources about the repository, maintainers, releases and other
  security aspects in a machine-readable format to make it easy for
  automated tools to locate them.

  For more information on how to create one, refer to the [SI
  specification](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/).
