description: Verifies that any actions use pinned tags
guidance: |
  Please change the action to use a pinned SHA-1 hash instead of a tag.

  Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use
  an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate
  the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they
  would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.
  When selecting a SHA, you should verify it is from the action's repository
  and not a repository fork.
