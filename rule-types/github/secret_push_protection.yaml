version: v1
release_phase: beta
type: rule-type
name: secret_push_protection
display_name: Enable secret push protection to avoid pushing hardcoded secrets
severity:
  value: high
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  Verifies that secret push protection is enabled for a given repository.
  Note that this will will not work as expected for private repositories
  unless you have GitHub Advanced Security enabled. If you still want to use
  this rule because you have a mixture of private and public repositories,
  enable the `skip_private_repos` flag.
guidance: |
  Ensure that secret scanning push protection is enabled for the
  repository.

  You can use secret scanning to prevent supported secrets from being
  pushed into your repository by enabling secret scanning push
  protection.

  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations#enabling-secret-scanning-as-a-push-protection-for-a-repository).
