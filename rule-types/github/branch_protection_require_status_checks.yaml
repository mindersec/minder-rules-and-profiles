description: Require status checks to pass before merging pull requests
guidance: |
  Ensure that the setting to require status checks before merging is
  enabled for the branch protection rule.

  This requires all configured status checks to pass before merging.

  For more information, see [GitHub's
  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
