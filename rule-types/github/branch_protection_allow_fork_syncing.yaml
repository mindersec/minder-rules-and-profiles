description: Whether users can pull changes from upstream when the branch is locked
guidance: |
  Ensure that the appropriate setting is enabled for the branch
  protection rule.

  This setting allows users with push access to pull changes from the
  upstream repository.

  For more information, see [GitHub's
  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
