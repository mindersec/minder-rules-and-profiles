description: |
  For every pull request submitted to a repository, this rule will
  check if the pull request adds a new change patch with invisible characters.
  If it does, the rule will fail and the pull request will be commented on.

  This detects and highlights the use of invisible characters
  that could potentially hide malicious code.
  
  The characters classified as "invisible" can be found at

guidance: |
  Ensure that the pull request does not contain any invisible
  characters.

  Invisible characters can be used to hide malicious code and can be
  difficult to detect. It is important to ensure that the code is
  clean and does not contain any hidden characters.

  For more information on the potential security implications, see the
  article ["Trojan Source: Invisible
  Vulnerabilities"](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-boucher.pdf).
