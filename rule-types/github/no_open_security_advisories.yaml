name: no_open_security_advisories
severity:
  value: low
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  Verifies that a repository has no open security advisories based on a given severity threshold.

  The threshold will cause the rule to fail if there are any open advisories at or above the threshold.
  It is set to `high` by default, but can be overridden by setting the `severity` parameter.
guidance: |
  Ensuring that a repository has no open security advisories helps maintain a secure codebase.

  This rule will fail if the repository has unacknowledged security advisories.
  It will also fail if the repository has no security advisories enabled.

  Security advisories that are closed or published are considered to be acknowledged.

  For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).
