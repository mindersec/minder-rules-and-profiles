description: Verifies that the Trivy action is enabled for the repository and scanning
guidance: |
  Ensure that the Trivy action is enabled for the repository and
  scanning is performed.

  Trivy is an open source vulnerability scanner for repositories,
  containers and other artifacts provided by Aqua Security. It is used
  to scan for vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies. This
  rule ensures that the Trivy action is enabled for the repository and
  scanning is performed.

  Set it up by adding the following to your workflow:

  ```yaml
  - name: Trivy Scan
    uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@d710430a6722f083d3b36b8339ff66b32f22ee55 # v0.19.0
    with:
      image-ref: ${{ github.repository }}
      format: json
      exit-code: 1
  ```
  
  For more information, see [Trivy Action's
  documentation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aqua-security-trivy).
