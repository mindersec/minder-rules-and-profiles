  This rule verifies that branches are deleted automatically once a pull
  request merges.
guidance: |
  Ensure that automatic branch deletion is enabled for your repositories.

  To manage whether branches should be automatically deleted for your repository
  you need to toggle the "Automatically delete head branches" setting in the
  general configuration of your repository.

  For more information, see the GitHub documentation on the topic: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches
