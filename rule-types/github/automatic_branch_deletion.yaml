description: |
  This rule verifies that branches are deleted automatically once a pull
  request merges.
guidance: |
  Ensure that automatic branch deletion is enabled for your
  repositories.

  To manage whether branches should be automatically deleted for your
  repository you need to toggle the "Automatically delete head
  branches" setting in the general configuration of your repository.

  For more information, see the [GitHub's
  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).
