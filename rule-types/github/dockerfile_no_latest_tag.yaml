display_name: Prevent Dockerfile from using volatile 'latest' tag
short_failure_message: Dockerfile uses the 'latest' tag, which may lead to unpredictable behavior due to version volatility.

description: Verifies that the Dockerfile image references don't use the latest tag
guidance: |
  Ensure that the Dockerfile does not use the `latest` tag for images.

  Using the latest tag for Docker images is not recommended as it can
  lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to use a checksum
  instead, as that's immutable and will always point to the same
  image.
