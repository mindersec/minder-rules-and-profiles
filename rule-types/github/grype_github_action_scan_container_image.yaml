description: |
  This rule checks whether the Grype GitHub Action is enabled to scan container images for vulnerabilities.
  Grype, a vulnerability scanner from Anchore, provides a robust mechanism to identify issues in container images. 
  Implementing this action helps maintain secure and compliant workflows for containerized applications.

guidance: |
  Enable the Grype GitHub Action in your GitHub Actions workflow to scan container images for vulnerabilities. 
  
  You can add the Grype action to your workflow using the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  - name: Scan image
    uses: anchore/scan-action@v6.0.0
    with:
      image: "your-image-reference"
  ```

  For more details, refer to the [Grype action documentation](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action).
