  For every pull request submitted to a repository, this rule will
  check if the pull request adds a new change patch
  that contains mixed scripts. 

  If it does, the rule will fail and the pull request will be commented on.

  This detects and highlights the use of strings with mixed scripts 
  that could potentially hide malicious code.
  
  For more information, see
  https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Mixed_Script_Detection
  and

guidance: |
  Ensure that the pull request does not contain any mixed scripts.
