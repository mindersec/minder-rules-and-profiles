short_failure_message: Pull request contains mixed scripts, which may hide malicious code.

description: |
  Ensure that the pull request does not contain any mixed scripts.
guidance: |
  For every pull request submitted to a repository, this rule will
  check if the pull request adds a new change patch that contains
  mixed scripts.

  If it does, the rule will fail and the pull request will be
  commented on.

  This detects and highlights the use of strings with mixed scripts
  that could potentially hide malicious code.

  Detection"](https://unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Mixed_Script_Detection)
  and ["Trojan Source: Invisible
  Vulnerabilities"](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-boucher.pdf).
