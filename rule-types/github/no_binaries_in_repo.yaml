  Verifies that no binary artifacts are commited to the repository

  This rule incorporates the check from Scorecard for binary artifacts.

  It determines whether a binary artifact has been committed to the repository.

  For more information, see https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts
guidance: |
  If you find that a binary artifact has been committed to the repository, you should
  consider removing it from the repository and using a package manager to install it instead.
