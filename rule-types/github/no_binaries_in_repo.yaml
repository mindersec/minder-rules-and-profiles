  Verifies that no binary artifacts are commited to the repository
guidance: |
  This rule incorporates the check from Scorecard for binary
  artifacts. It determines whether a binary artifact has been
  committed to the repository.

  If you find that a binary artifact has been committed to the
  repository, you should consider removing it from the repository and
  using a package manager to install it instead.

  For more information, see [OpenSSF Scorecard's
  documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts).
