short_failure_message: Grype GitHub Action is not enabled for repository scanning.

description: |
  This rule checks whether the Grype GitHub Action is enabled to scan the repository for vulnerabilities.
  
  Grype, a vulnerability scanner from Anchore, provides a robust mechanism to identify vulnerabilities.
  Implementing this action helps maintain secure and compliant dependencies for applications.

guidance: |
  Enable the Grype GitHub Action in your GitHub Actions workflow to scan repositories for vulnerabilities. 
  
  You can add the Grype action to your workflow using the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  - name: Scan image
    uses: anchore/scan-action@v6.0.0
    with:
      path: "."
  ```

  For more details, refer to the [Grype action documentation](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action).
