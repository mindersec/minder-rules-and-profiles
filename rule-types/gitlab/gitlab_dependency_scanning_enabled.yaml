description: |
  GitLab Dependency Scanning is a feature that helps you find known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. It is recommended to enable this feature to help secure your codebase.

  For more information, see the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/).
guidance: |
  Ensure that GitLab Dependency Scanning is enabled for the repository. This can be done by navigating to the repository settings in GitLab and enabling the Dependency Scanning feature.

  To enable GitLab Dependency Scanning:
  * Enable [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) in the project settings.
  * Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  ```

  For more information, see the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/).
