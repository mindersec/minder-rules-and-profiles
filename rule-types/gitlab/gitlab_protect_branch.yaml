description: |
  Protected branches are useful for ensuring that certain branches cannot be deleted or force-pushed to.
  This rule checks if a branch is set as protected and that allowing force-pushes is disabled.
guidance: |
  Ensure that the given branch is set as protected to prevent accidental deletions or force-pushes.

  For more information, see the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html).
