display_name: Require everyone to submit merge requests for a protected branch
short_failure_message: Branch is not set to require merge requests
severity:
  value: medium

  provider: gitlab
release_phase: alpha
description: |
  Merge requests are a way to propose changes to a branch and allow for code review before merging.
  This rule leverages the protected branch feature to ensure that all changes to a branch are submitted via a merge request.
guidance: |
  Ensure that the given branch is set as protected. You should ensure that the "Allowed to merge"
  setting is set to "Maintainers" or "Developers + Maintainers", and that the "Allowed to push and merge"
  setting is set to "No one".

  For more information, see the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html).
