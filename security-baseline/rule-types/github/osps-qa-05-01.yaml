display_name: Version control does not contain binary artifacts
short_failure_message: Binary artifacts found in the repository

  value: high

description: |
  This rule ensures that the repository does not contain any generated executable
  artifacts.  It is difficult to review and ascertain the provenance of binary
  artifacts; instead, they should be generated at build time or stored in a separate
  store (such as a package repository) and fetched during specific well-documented
  pipeline steps.
guidance: |
  Replace executable binary artifacts in the repository with build pipeline scripts
  which install the necessary commands after validating their authenticity (for
  example, by verifying checksums or signatures).
