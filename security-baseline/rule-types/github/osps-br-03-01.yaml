description: Verifies that websites and version control systems for development use secure channels.
guidance: |
  Any websites and version control systems involved in the project
  development MUST be delivered using SSH, HTTPS, or other encrypted
  channels.

  Protect the confidentiality and integrity of project source code during
  development, reducing the risk of eavesdropping or data tampering.

  GitHub does this by default.
