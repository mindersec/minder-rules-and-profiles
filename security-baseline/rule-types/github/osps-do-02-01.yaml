  Ensures that public feedback (via GitHub issues and/or discussions)
  are available for users of the software, allowing them to report bugs
  and suggest improvements.
guidance: |
  Ensure that issues or discussions are enabled on the repository, and
  that users can view issues and find reports from other users.

  This rule will not currently detect the usage of an external feedback
  system (for example, Jira or Trello).
