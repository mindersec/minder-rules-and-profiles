  Verifies that the project documentation provides a user guide.

  This rule attempts to locate user guides from several project documentation sources.

  Currently, this rule checks the following:

  * The GitHub repository's public link
  * A `docs` directory in the default branch of the repository with .md, .rst, .html or .txt files
  * A `documentation` entry in SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yaml
  * A `README.md` file containing preformatted text (triple-backtick) or the headings
   "usage" or "getting started"

  For more information, see [OpenSSF Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/#osps-do-0101).
guidance: |
  Publish documentation in one of the following well-known locations:

  * Set the repository homepage to a documentation URL.
  * Add a SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yaml file with a `documentation` entry
  * Create a `docs` directory in the default branch of the repository
  * Add a "usage" or "getting started" section to `README.md`
