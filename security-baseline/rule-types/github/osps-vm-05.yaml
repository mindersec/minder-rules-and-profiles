display_name: Contacts and process for reporting vulnerabilities is published
short_failure_message: No contacts or process for reporting vulnerabilities was found
severity:
  value: info
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  This rule ensures that the repository provides a clear process and contact information 
  for reporting vulnerabilities. 
  It checks for the presence of a SECURITY.md file containing relevant reporting 
  details or verifies if GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature is enabled.
guidance: |
  To address this issue:
  1. Add a `SECURITY.md` file to your repository:
     - Ensure it includes instructions for reporting vulnerabilities, including contact details and a clear process.
     - Refer to [GitHub's documentation on SECURITY.md](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security).
  2. Alternatively, enable GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
     - Navigate to the repository's "Settings" - "Security and Analysis."
     - Enable "Private vulnerability reporting."
